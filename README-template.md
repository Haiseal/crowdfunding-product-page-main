### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

### Continued development

One area of continued development in front-end development is the advancement of user interface (UI) design and development. As technology and user expectations continue to evolve, there is an increasing demand for more intuitive, engaging, and responsive user interfaces that provide a seamless user experience. This requires front-end developers to keep up with the latest trends, tools, and techniques in UI design and development.Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
